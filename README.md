## ðŸ“‹ Presentation :
This project demonstrates the integration of a user interface developed in Qt C++ to control a 3D object visualized in Unity. The Qt user interface allows the user to manipulate the properties of the 3D object, such as its position, rotation, and instantiate GameObjects, while Unity is used to visualize the 3D object and apply the modifications in real time.

## ðŸŒŸ Features :

- Qt C++ user interface to control a 3D object in Unity.
- Connection system (database)
- Control of the position, and rotation of the 3D object and instantiate new GameObject.
- Real-time visualization of modifications made to the 3D object in Unity.

## ðŸ”§ Required Configuration :

- [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download) : Qt Creator is used to develop the user interface in C++.
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) : Unity is used to visualize the 3D object and receive control commands.

## ðŸ’» Installation :

**Note for Users:**

This project has specific configuration requirements in terms of compatibility between the server and the client.

- The **Unity server** included in this project is specifically designed to run on **Windows** due to Unity's compatibility with this platform.

- The **Qt C++ client**, on the other hand, has been developed and tested on **Linux**. However, it may be possible to run it on other platforms, but this has not been tested.

âžœ [Install the client](https://github.com/Manon-Arc/IHM_Unity-Qt.git)  <br>
